TODO:
- RBDat.txt seems to contain descriptions and not frame data?
    - Don't know if this issue is on NNC's end or OptiTracker's.
- Move frame_listeners to __unpack_mocap_data.
    - In hindsight, hiding them in each __unpack function just adds to API opacity.
- Attach frame_prefix to returned frames.
- Define SQL DBs for each asset type.
- Parcel out frame data into respective DBs.



Notes:
- Should there be unique listeners for each asset type?
- Or, a single listener?
    - If so, should it always return all asset types, even when empty?
    - Or, conditionally return asset types specified by the user?
        - Oh, maybe this is just a matter of checking MoCapData objs respective counters?
- Ideally, future versions of OptiTracker will only spawn DBs as needed.
- Lines 181-184 in NatNetClient.py (tmp_commands) make me wonder what other commands are available
    - Would be great if these could be used to procedurally label & record takes by trial.
